I never thought we would hear about “self-identification” in RWRI
Omar Javaid to Everyone (9:06 PM)
me
Joseph Shipman to Everyone (9:10 PM)
I’m glad “Long Island” is a category, it’s slightly more respectable than “consultant” for me. But I get paid by the hour to do math so I must identify as both.

Ecosystem has huge past dependence, for example foundational effect. If a species arrive earlier to a place it may dominate, even if not the most fit. That might be why plans are dominated by green color and no a more bluish one.

As an individual or company, you can not privatise the gains and socialise the losses to society. In the end it will blow up your collective / society / Licence to Operate.

Evellyn Verity to Everyone (9:35 PM)
Can you please explain what does "looking from the tail" mean? I don't think I understand correctly
Oliver López-Corona (@otrasenda_ac) to Everyone (9:38 PM)
That it is the uncommon (the outlier) events that you have to protect from… those events are in what is called the tail.
Pasquale Cirillo to Everyone (9:38 PM)
Yes, I am (on a train now, that is why I do not use the webcam).
Leigh Cash to Everyone (9:39 PM)
This slide makes the case against lawyers… if I want folks to have skin in the game then you need fewer lawyers adding complications.
Richard Jenkins to Everyone (9:41 PM)
@Evellyn - If you look from the “body” of a data distribution (e.g., the “average” or “mean”), outlying events are viewed as improbable. If you start from the tail and assume that outlying events happen more than they “should,” then the distribution looks much different. Ex: The “average” return of the S&P could be 12% per annum. If that’s your anchor, a 30% drop would seem impossible—until it happens.
Joseph Shipman to Everyone (9:41 PM)
having had Covid does not make you stronger, except maybe for the benefit of immunity to future Covid conferring social advantages
Christopher Varian to Everyone (9:41 PM)
you gain a level of immunity
Wilhelm Kolkman to Everyone (9:44 PM)
It is also relatively easy to make something complicated.
It requires mastery to keep things simple.
Raphael Douady to Everyone (9:44 PM)
Richard: yes but more than that, once in the tails, the world doesn't behave the same. The statistics, the odds of such or such event occurring are completely different, making you focus on different things.
Richard Jenkins to Everyone (9:44 PM)
Great point @Raphael! Also, it’s a pleasure to meet you and to be here!
Raphael Douady to Everyone (9:45 PM)
Welcome!
Evellyn Verity to Everyone (9:47 PM)

Yi Shi to Everyone (9:53 PM)
So in the context of a portfolio, taking would taking concentrated, non-diversified risks advantageous given the scale down? Or does it increase its exposure to tail risk? Or perhaps the latter would be more characterized as mediocristan?

A nice example of SITG for safety: to make a mine safe, the only thing the miners wanted was the office of the managers to be located in the mine......

Yes but not only! The agendas initiated the machine, but it then self-nurtured. Now people claim "hard facts" where the rulers themselves are erroneous (up to the tests, the casualties, etc.)

That is the fingerprint of Messner wisdom… best rock climbing but switch to alpinism, then with to high altitude, then switch to polar exploration… he switched when risk accumulation on a specific field got too dangerous. On the other side Kukuczka, didn’t even after climbed all 14 8,000m, he went looking for more dangerous routes. So he died.

For a non-technical overview of the Kelly Criterion, check out “Fortune’s Formula” by Poundstone.
Andrew Zipp to Everyone (10:40 PM)
Great book
Oskar Thoren to Everyone (10:40 PM)
"A Man for All Markets" by Ed Thorp is also good, autobiography
Oskar Thoren to Everyone (10:41 PM)
"KELLY CAPITAL GROWTH INVESTMENT CRITERION, THE: THEORY AND PRACTICE (World Scientific Handbook in Financial Economic) " for more math/theory is interesting too, though a bit heavy
Richard Jenkins to Everyone (10:41 PM)
Didn’t Nassim help with that one?
Oskar Thoren to Everyone (10:42 PM)
not that I'm aware of, MacLean, Thorp, Ziemba as editors
Luiz Fernando Roxo to Everyone (10:42 PM)
great book
Andrew Zipp to Everyone (10:42 PM)
James Gleick, “The Information a History, A Theory a Flood. is also good.
Juan Andres Garcia Alvarez to Everyone (10:43 PM)
Another example re: kosher conversation comes to mind.... Unlike other commodities, most tree nuts you buy in supermarkets, combine product from two or more countries of origin, despite different characteristics and taste. They lack provenance and crop year, something most consumers demand in other products. It is valuable for niche markets, yet too cumbersome for wholesalers and distributors.
Oskar Thoren to Everyone (10:43 PM)

Joseph Shipman to Everyone (10:58 PM)
in the early 90’s I worked for Sanford Bernstein, a money manager, and they had some investment managers with gambling experience, so they used a “Kelly” parameter in their models, and it bothered me because the probability distributions were not only not Gaussian but also not known, only estimated. but I couldn’t articulate this criticism at the time.
Jeremy Rotstein to Everyone (10:58 PM)
Early start Omar!
Esa-Pekka Pälvimäki to Everyone (10:58 PM)
17:15 sorry
Marcus Richard to Everyone (11:02 PM)
@Richard Jenkins You are welcome to steal it! A famous romainan chessmaster that explained very well the technique of flexibility is Mihai Suba. His book "Dynamic chess srategy". I had the chance to meet and play with Suba when he was playing tournaments in Spain.
Marcus Richard to Everyone (11:02 PM)
For the historical record, this theory of flexibility is pretty modern in chess.
Joseph Shipman to Everyone (11:10 PM)
it’s not that modern. Lasker was writing about it 100 years ago.
Yi Shi to Everyone (11:10 PM)
For folks who are in sustainable investing by any chance, do you think the transition risk/carbon risk is mediocrastan or extremistan? Or it depends if there is a tipping point?

hmm so stronger resiliency/redundancy - between fragility and anti-fragility then
Paavo Hietanen to Everyone (11:13 PM)
Yi Shi do you mean carbon leak? (countires with no carbon tax starting to invest in tech with higher CO2?)
Jeremy Rotstein to Everyone (11:14 PM)
slides aren't uploaded yet, bear with us
Raphael Douady to Everyone (11:14 PM)
With current technology, by far the most efficient for CO2 is nuclear energy. Orders of magnitude
Yi Shi to Everyone (11:15 PM)
I'm waiting for nuclear fission to commercialize - game changer - antifragility!
Joseph Shipman to Everyone (11:16 PM)
I’m not in sustainable investing. but there has been a great deal of noise about this issue. biggest question is if we are “in sample” or “out of sample” in terms of CO2 concentration and warming trends, much data fudging has occurred to make it look like we are outside historical norms in order to stoke fear. if we ARE outside historical norms then we should be precautionary, and also if we are not sure whether we are, but there are also many who benefit from making this appear to be the case.
Marcus Richard to Everyone (11:17 PM)
@Joseph Shipman It is quite possible that different versions of flexibility were used long time ago. I would love to have a precise reference to flexibility by Lasker. Maybe in his chess manual? What I am pretty sure is that nobody did develop it in the opening as Suba. It lead to reevaluation of some opening lines.
Oliver López-Corona (@otrasenda_ac) to Everyone (11:19 PM)
Entropy not absolute scale (contrary to i.e. temperature) makes that you can’t compare it among systems, right?
Raphael Douady to Everyone (11:21 PM)
From the physical point of view (there are many definitions of entropy), temperature is an "intensive" measure: that of A+B is the average of that of A and B. Entropy is an extensive measure: that of A+B is the sum (well, not exactly, but more like a sum than an average)
Jack Yu to Everyone (11:21 PM)
@Joseph Shipman, our Bayesian prior for CO2 on historical terms is not informative for future. (e.g. we are  1 single large volcanic activity from needing to remodel everything)
Wilhelm Kolkman to Everyone (11:24 PM)
Does the exaple mean the concept of correlation is not correct, or that we can only talk about some correlation if R^2 > say 0.5
Diego Zviovich to Everyone (11:25 PM)
P value fishing
Oskar Thoren to Everyone (11:25 PM)
relevant xkcd https://xkcd.com/882/
Jack Yu to Everyone (11:26 PM)
Correlation != Mutual Information. In this case, Mutual Information (X, Y) = 0
Raphael Douady to Everyone (11:26 PM)
2 problems: number of samples (if sufficiently many, then a large correlation is meaningful), and stability of statistics (past correlation isn't the same as future)
Richard Jenkins to Everyone (11:27 PM)
@Oskar - Reminds me of the joke that the data shows lung cancer could be the cause of smoking.
Jack Yu to Everyone (11:29 PM)
@Raphael, what do you mean by “meaningful”?
Raphael Douady to Everyone (11:30 PM)
Better than that: taking cardiologic treatment causes heart attacks, as those who take them have heart attcks much more often than those who don't...
Leigh Cash to Everyone (11:30 PM)
@Richard - hahaha - you never know… maybe the genetic breaks for lung cancer trigger you to crave smoking…
Richard Jenkins to Everyone (11:31 PM)
@Leigh - I’m sure Philip Morris is funding some researcher at Duke to prove just that.
Raphael Douady to Everyone (11:32 PM)
Now check how many "scientific" studies on COVID treatment fall (voluntarily or not) into this trap...

Ramiro Barrantes Reynolds to Everyone (11:41 PM)
Raphael, why do you say that an observational study is worth more than the double blind?
Oliver López-Corona (@otrasenda_ac) to Everyone (11:41 PM)
very bad incentives in academia for Publish or perish (money and time required for rigor).
Joseph Shipman to Everyone (11:42 PM)
it’s not enough to run it forward. you must also preregister it.
Raphael Douady to Everyone (11:42 PM)
A double blind study summarizes everything in a small set of variables that are set in advance. So they will miss any unexpected effect. Observational studies tell what happens, and have a 360 degree view of rthe problem.
Joseph Shipman to Everyone (11:42 PM)
